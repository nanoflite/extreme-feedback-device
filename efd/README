Hi,

  These are the source files for the extreme feedback device I've build.
  The layout is as follows:

  docs/
    Contains the schematic and an image or two of the finished device.
  firmware/
    The source files for the firmware. I used an ATTiny2313 for it, but you can probably use other
    AVRs as well. Please look at the documentation for the excellent AVR-USB driver at
    http://www.obdev.at/products/avrusb/index.html to find out which devices are supported.
  driver/
    The source files for libusb driver. As far as I know, libusb works on Win32, Linux and OSX,
    but I've only used it on Linux (SuSE10.2), so don't expect it all to work out-of-the-box
    on the other operating systems.
  CCrb/
    Plugin for CruiseControlrb to use the device as build feedback.

  Best regards,
  Johan
